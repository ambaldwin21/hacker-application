Please answer the following general questions:

1. When can you start?
  I can start immediately.

2. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?
  Just May 26 (Friday before Memorial Day Weekend) and then several days for my brother's wedding, June 8 and 9.

3. SparkFun is a dog-friendly environment. Are comfortable working around dogs? If you are a dog-owner, would you see yourself bringing dogs to work?
  Yes, I love dogs! I do have a very friendly dog, and I would consider bringing her in after a few months once I've gotten the hang of things.

4. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development and technology. Where do you you get your news?
  I go to few area Meetups that discuss recent happenings in the tech world, as well as to help continue my tech education. I also listen to the podcast JavaScript Jabber and subscribe to a few weekly e-newsletters, too: JavaScript Weekly and FrontEnd Focus. I also find good news on TechNewsWorld.

5. The sane developer does things other than writing code. What else occupies your time?
  I'm a huge backcountry skier (with my dog). I love picking out a zone to go explore, consulting maps, doing route research, navigating, making calculated decisions on the snow conditions, plus problem solving in the backcountry. I also enjoy cooking, backpacking, hiking, good beer, finding the best taco in Boulder county, and spending time with friends and family.

6. The worldly developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, music, film, etc.). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?
  I'm reading constantly, and I belong to a book club. I enjoy discussing various books with folks to get a new perspective on the story. I also love live music and try to go to a show at least once a month. It's very lucky that Colorado has a great music scene!

7. Please critique any of the SparkFun websites. With influence over the SparkFun dev team what would *you* focus on improving?
  The SparkFun websites that I have viewed are all very clean and easy to navigate. I really like how quick and easy it is to purchase products - the whole shopping cart process is very intuitive, as well as the whole navigation process to everywhere on the websites. I like the simple, yet effective animations - the bouncing shopping cart for example. On sparkfuneducation.com, I love the design and easily navigatable menu options. That being said, and as the usability seems to be very solid, I think my critiques would be mostly on visual items - some spacing fixes so as to make an even stronger first impression and then, the shopping cart button is in a slightly odd, off-centered spot on each product photo. We also discussed via the phone chat about switching the front-end to React or another framework down the line, and I think that's huge and one of the more important things to improve. Using a single page application architecture makes it so the UX is even more lightening fast (smoother experience, less wait time) and then less requests to the server is needed, also. Plus, it would also make the code more easily readable and reusable, which is important for large code bases.
