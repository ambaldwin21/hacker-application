Please answer the following general questions:

1. When can you start?
I can start immediately.

2. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?
Just a few short days - May 26 (Friday before Memorial Day Weekend) and then several days for my brother's wedding - June 8 and 9.

3. SparkFun is a dog-friendly environment. Are comfortable working aroung dogs? If you are a dog-owner, would you see yourself bringing dogs to work?
Yes, I love dogs! I do have a dog, and she's about 3 years old. I would consider bringing her in - she's very friendly and adorable - though, I'd want to wait until after I got the hang of things. So, after a few months on the job she would make an appearance.

4. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development and technology. Where do you you get your news?
I go to a lot of area Meetups in Boulder and Denver that discuss recent happenings in the tech world. I also listen to the podcast JavaScript Jabber and subscribe to a few weekly e-newsletters, too: JavaScript Weekly and FrontEnd Focus. I also find good news on TechNewsWorld.

5. The sane developer does things other than writing code. What else occupies your time?
I'm a huge backcountry skier. I love picking out a zone to go explore, consulting maps, doing route research, navigating, making calculated decisions on the snow conditions and the routes, plus problem solving in the backcountry. The ski turns on the way down is just an added bonus! I also like cooking, backpacking, hiking, good beer, and spending time with friends and family.

6. The worldly developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, music, film, etc.). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?
I'm a huge reader, and I belong to a book club. I enjoy discussing various books to get a new perspective on the story. We just finished The Zookeeper's Wife. I also love live music and try to go to a show at least once a month. It's very lucky that Colorado has a great music scene!

7. Please critique any of the SparkFun websites. With influence over the SparkFun dev team what would *you* focus on improving?
Honestly, the SparkFun websites that I have viewed are all very clean and easy to navigate. I really like how quick and easy it is to purchase products - the whole shopping cart process is very intuitive, as well as the whole navigation process to everywhere on the website. I like the little animations everywhere - the bouncing shopping cart and then on sparkfuneducation.com, I love the design and easily navigatable menu options. That being said - and as the usability seems to be very solid -, I think my critiques would be mostly on visual items - some spacing fixes and then, the shopping cart button is in a slightly odd, off-centered spot on each product photo. The main page is also a little cluttered. Designing something that is bolder and less wordy and with clear separation between sections would really make a strong first impression.
